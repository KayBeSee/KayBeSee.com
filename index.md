Hey! My name is Kevin Mulcrone.

I'm a Software Engineer at [Losant](http://losant.com){:target="_blank"}, an Internet of Things application enablement platform which allows enterprises to effectively build applications and create solutions that securely scale to millions of devices. . 

When I was in high school I taught myself how to program in order to launch The Perfect Level, an online marketplace that facilitated the sales of Halo 3 and Call of Duty 4 profiles between gamers. I made some money building that, but it was mostly just a way to justify the uncountable hours spent playing Halo 3 with my best friends to my mom.

In 2017, I graduated from Xavier University with a degree in Computer Science and Philosophy, Politics, & The Public (PPP).

My senior year I wrote a thesis paper called [Free Money: How Distrust Severed Governmentâ€™s Role in Banking and Why the Civil War Reunited It]({{site.url}}/assets/Free Money - Kevin Mulcrone - Spring 17.pdf){:target="_blank"} because I was interested in the ideas that F.A. Hayek talked about in his book [The Denationalization of Money](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/denationalisation.pdf){:target="_blank"}. The paper examines how the Free Banking Era (1837-1864) came about in the United States, the way it functioned, and what eventually brought about its demise by paralleling the events during that 30 year period to what John Locke discusses in his Second Treatise on Government. Here is the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKNCEA5Oe8I){:target="_blank"} of my presentation if you're interested.

I'm convinced that entrepreneurship and technology will help foster a society that is more free, productive, ethical, and _fun_ than our world today. I'm interested in working towards aligning my interest in economics with my computer science skills in order to help speed up this process. In particular, I'm curious about how the internet has affected individuals' relationship with one another and how digital currencies like Bitcoin might foster economies that run parallel to the current banking system.

In my free time, I like traveling to new places, being outside, riding my Salsa Vaya bicycle, seeing live music, and working on interesting projects. Because of my dissatisfaction with the presidential candidates last election cycle, I launched [Panic 2016](http://panic2016.com/){:target="_blank"}, a parody campaign to get my favorite band Widespread Panic elected President because I'm poor, and laughter is cheap medicine.
