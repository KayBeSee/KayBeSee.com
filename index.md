Hey! My name is Kevin Mulcrone.

I'm a Software Engineer at [Losant](http://losant.com){:target="_blank"} and building [Terrapin Ticketing](http://terrapinticketing.com){:target="_blank"} in my free time because I think Ticketmaster is the [Richard Nixon](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1068712-richard-nixon-has-never-been-one-of-my-favorite-people){:target="_blank"}  of the live event experience. I graduated from Xavier University in 2017 with a degree in Computer Science and Philosophy, Politics, & The Public (PPP).

I learned to program during my freshman year of high school in order to launch an online business called The Perfect Level. It was an online marketplace built using Wordpress and WooCommerce in order to facilitate the sales of Halo 3 and Call of Duty 4 gamer profiles. I made some money doing that but it was mostly just a way to justify the uncountable hours spent playing Halo 3 with my best friends to my mom.

I'm convinced that entrepreneurship and technology will help foster a society that is more free, productive, moral and fun than our world today. I am working towards aligning my passion for economics with my computer science skills in order to do this. I'm particularly interested in how the internet has affected individuals' relationship with one another and how Bitcoin will empower individuals by freeing money from the shackles of our current banking system.

My senior year I wrote a thesis paper called [Free Money: How Distrust Severed Governmentâ€™s Role in Banking and Why the Civil War Reunited It]({{site.url}}/assets/Free Money - Kevin Mulcrone - Spring 17.pdf){:target="_blank"} because I was interested in the ideas that F.A. Hayek talked about in his book [The Denationalization of Money](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/denationalisation.pdf){:target="_blank"}. The paper examines how the Free Banking Era (1837-1864) came about in the United States, the way it functioned, and what eventually brought about its demise by paralleling the events during that 30 year period to what John Locke discusses in his Second Treatise on Government. Here is the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKNCEA5Oe8I){:target="_blank"} of my presentation if you're interested.

In my free time, I like traveling, backpacking, seeing live music, and working on interesting projects. Because of my dissatisfaction with the presidential candidates this election cycle, I launched [Panic 2016](http://panic2016.com/){:target="_blank"}, a parody campaign to get my favorite band Widespread Panic elected President because I'm poor, and laughter is cheap medicine.
