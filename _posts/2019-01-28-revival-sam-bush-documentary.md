I rented Revival: The Sam Bush Story last night on Amazon after seeing the trailer a few months back. Here are some thoughts on the movie.

Overall I thought it was a good movie although I wish they toned it back with the commentary on how awesome Sam is. I felt like they could have taken half of the interview cuts from modern players like Paul Hoffman and replaced them with some more depth about Sam's life or pushed deeper into the controversy of him and New Grass Revival pushing away from traditional bluegrass.

I didn't realize that Sam had testicular cancer when he was around 30 or that he and Sierra Hull had played together when she was 10 years old. I think that clip was one of my favorites throughout the documentary.
