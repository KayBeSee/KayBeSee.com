Over a year ago I set out to start a new business called Terrapin Ticketing in order to make buying, selling, and transferring tickets online easier and more secure. Ultimately, Terrapin has not turned into the success Michael and I envisioned when we started. It is one of the most exciting things I've done in my life up to this point, however, and the skills I gained while doing it will be invaluable as I continue with my career.

That's why I wanted to take some time to reflect upon what I learned:

## Start on the Side
Everyone wants to run a bad ass company and wallow in fame as they raise money and build products. Don't do this. I have to admit, I think Michael and I did a very good job of this with Terrapin. We didn't raise any money, we didn't ICO, we just talked to customers and people we knew in the music industry who dealt with ticketing and putting on live events (and of course, we were our own customer, so we knew how to service that end).

We started out by working on the project full time though, which I don't recommend. Paul Graham [talks](http://paulgraham.com/before.html) about this in his essay "Before the Startup". Your startup should be a side project that starts taking off.

We were in a unique position because we didn't _have_ to work as a result the cryptocurrency boom in mid-to-late 2017, but going all in on a project is draining financially, psychologically, and socially, especially before finding product market fit.

## Exercise
Do it. Every day. 

Starting a company is a grueling task that comes with ups and downs. The only way to avoid burnout and to perform your best physically, mentally, and psychologically is by hitting the gym. I didn't do this as much as I should have when we were working at Terrapin and I think it would have really helped on those bad days. Not only that, getting out into the gym can be meditative and get you into a different environment from the office or home that allows you to look at the problems you've been working on in a different way.


## Location, Location, Location
Michael and I didn't rent an office when we were working on Terrapin and we lived in seperate apartments. There is a reason that companies that go through Y Combinator are instructed to work out of their homes while going through the program. It keeps everyone on the same page, builds comradery and chemistry within the team, and is self-motivating. We were lucky because Michael and I were genuinely good friends already, but I could imagine this being even more important for people entering a business relationship for purely financial reasons.




## Success and Work Ethic



Customer is Always Right

Connections + Networking
