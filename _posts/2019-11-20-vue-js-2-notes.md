Notes from Vue JS 2 - The Complete Guide (incl. Vue Router & Vuex) [Udemy Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/)

## Data Binding


### Double Curly Brackets ( \{\{ foo }} )
We render data using the double curly bracket:
```
<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
```


### v-bind:
The double curly bracket won't work on HTML elements, so we need to bind data using `v-bind`.

v-bind works by taking an arguement after the colin and a value after that:
```
<a v-bind:href="link">My Link</a>
```

### v-once
If we don't want a value to be updated after its initial render, we can attach `v-once` flag to it.
```
<h1 v-once>{{ title }}</h1>
```

### v-html
We can render HMTL from a data property using `v-html`:
```
<p v-html="formattedLink"></p>
```

## Events


### v-on
We can listen for events using the `v-on` directive:

```
<button v-on:click="increase">Click Me!</button>
```

This will automatically pass the event to the `increase` method in vue, so we can do something like:

```
increase: function(event) {
  this.foo = event.detail
}
```

We can also pass arguements to the method:

```
<button v-on:click="increase(2)">Click Me!</button>

increase: function(step) {
  this.count += step;
}
```

and we can pass arguements _and_ the event itself using `$event` which is a property generated by Vue.

```
<button v-on:click="increase(2, $event)">Click Me!</button>

increase: function(step, event) {
  this.count += step;
  this.foo = event.detail;
}
```

### Event Modifiers
There are built in event modifiers in Vue:

`.stop` - stopPropogation
`.prevent` - preventDefault

We can use them like:
```
<span v-on.mousemove.stop="">Dead Spot</span>
```

### Key Modifiers
There are also built in key modifiers in Vue:

These can be chained.

`enter` - only call function when "Enter" is pushed

```
<input type="text" v-on:keyup.enter.space="alertMe" />
```

## Two Way Data Binding
Vue does two-way data binding by utilizing the `v-model` property on elements.

```
<input type="text" v-model="name">
```

### Computed
```
computed: {
  output: function() {
    return this.counter > 5 ? 'Greater 5' : 'Less 5'
  }
}
```


Doesn't get called as a function. Everything in computed can be used just like properties in the data object. Always runs syncronously.

### Watch
Used for async properties;

```
watch: {
  counter: function(value) {
    var vm = this;
    setTimeout(function() {
        vm.counter = 0
    }), 200;
  }
}
```

### Shortcuts
We can use `@click` as a replacement for `v-on:` or `:href`

```
<button v-on:click="someFunction">Click Me</button>
<a v-bind:href="link">My Link</a>
```
is the same as
```
<button @click="someFunction">Click Me</button>
<a :href="link">My Link</a>
```


## Handling User Input with Forms

Two way data binding is still managed by using `v-model` on form components.

```
<input type="text" v-model="email" />


<script>
  export default {
    data() {
      return {
          email: 'kaybesee@gmail.com' // this sets an initial value
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```
