I am reading Deep Nutrition right now and the first chapter, the author really emphasizes how your genes and DNA mutate over time based on the environment it experiences. And part of that experience is the food you eat, the air you breath, the amount of sunlight you receive, anything you are exposed to ~~both internally and~~ externally (She hasn't talked about mental health and its effect on the genes, if there is such an effect).

In the first chapter, there was a passage that really made me pause and think. It said our genes and DNA mutate to help us _survive_. For some reason I found that compelling, and what the implications of that are. For some reason I have thought of the age that someone dies as predetermined or, minus getting run over by a car, most people just get arbitrarily old (75 - 100) and then die of some disease (cancer, ALS, heart attack, stroke, etc).

But our real reason for living healthy should be to survive. To live long and healthy lives so that we can see our children and grandchildren grow up. So we can have some lasting effect on the world that, even if just through your family (which is significant but underappreciated in and of itself).

I'm trying to come up with a counter arguement to that. I mean, there are plenty of people that die young, that die in their 40s and 50s from "natural" causes like disease, etc. I think this book would argue that those were caused by some genetic disorder that was either introduced because of the environment or habits you, your parents or grandparents lived.

_Survival_

What an complex concept. There are a few different angles it could be looked at, but I'm too tired for that.
