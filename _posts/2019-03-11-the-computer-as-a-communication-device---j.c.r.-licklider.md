But to communicate is more than to send and to receive. Do two tape
recorders communicate when they play to each other and record from each
other? Not really-not in our sense. We believe that communicators have
to do something nontrivial with the information they send and receive. And
we believe that we are entering a technological age in which we will be able
to interact with the richness of living information—not merely in the passive
way that we have become accustomed to using books and libraries, but as
active participants in an ongoing process, bringing something to it through
our interaction with it, and not simply receiving something from it by our
connection to it.

Society rightly distrusts the modeling done by a single mind. Society demands consensus, agreement, at least majority. Fundamentally, this
amounts to the requirement that individual models be compared and brought
into some degree of accord. The requirement is for communication, which
we now define concisely as “cooperative modeling” —cooperation in the construction, maintenance, and use of a model.

Many of the primary data the participants bring to the meeting are in
undigested and uncorrelated form. To each participant, his own collections
of data are interesting and important in and of themselves. And they are
more than files of facts and recurring reports. They are strongly influenced
by insight, subjective feelings, and educated guesses. Thus, each individual’s
data are reflected in his mental model. **Getting his colleagues to incorporate
his data into their models is the essence of the communications task.**
