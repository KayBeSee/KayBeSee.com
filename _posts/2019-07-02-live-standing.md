Stand tall, almighty one <br />
Stand up, renew <br />
Stand to an earlier time <br />
when you were _you_


Stand for your youth <br />
Stand firn and stand tall <br />
Stand to the world <br />
who doesn't know _you_ at all


Stand from your dreams <br />
Stand erect to life <br />
Stand in the face <br />
of your struggle and strife


For this is the time <br />
that you have been given <br />
Stand up to its challenge <br />
and be open to living
