I was just thinking of some existing financial infustructure and the concept of "Bitcoin ATMs" that exist today.

With the introduction of the lightning network and the maturity of custodial technology like hardware wallets, etc. it would seem like Bitcoin is now capable of operating like traditional money. What I mean like this is that all of the components of money that exist in the current financial system are there:

Bank = Hardware Wallet, or Coinbase
Wallet/Cash = Lightning

There isn't a good way of moving funds from your secure hardware wallet to your lightning network wallet. Well there is, but if we wanted to drive mainstream adoption, it would be easy for the average consumer to have their paycheck deposited into a hardware wallet address or in coinbase and then allow you to transfer the funds from your secure account to your LN wallet.
