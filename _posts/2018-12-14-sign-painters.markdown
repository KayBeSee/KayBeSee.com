I watched [Sign Painters](https://amzn.to/2Ce5gdK) last week after looking at Mike Meyer's [hand lettering workshops](https://betterletters.co/workshops/) online.

It was a very interesting documentary about the culture surrounding Sign Painting and highlighted some of the remaining sign painters throughout the country while lamenting the downfall of the industry and its replacement by computers and othe technology.

#### Notes

Typeface / Font - Group of letter forms that work in a system. Context is mutable.
Lettering - Drawing of a letter or group of letters. Custom. Single context.

Book - [Sign Painters Don't Read Signs](https://amzn.to/2Bn1ehF). Commentary on the downfall of sign making as a profession and occupation

Vinyl and software -> No background in design, all motivated by money
