|         | 1.7    | Opening in mountains (valley). Lots of wildflowers. Walk through / swim through them.                                                                                    |
| 9:00am  | 2      | Steep rock steps. Well marked. Rewarded with view of waterfall. Take trail to the right, don't try to go along waterfall. Too steep.                                     |

|         | 2.9    | Wooded, dirt terrain. Some incline.                                                                                                                                      |
| 9:35am  | 3.1    | Cross river. Suns out!                                                                                                                                                   |

|         | 4.1    | Swiss Alps feel. Mountains on three sides. Big rocks, grass, dirt, pine trees.                                                                                           |

| 11:00am | 5.3    | Made it to the lake! Walk along path to the right and found a rock to lean against and eat lunch. I like looking the way I came in. Less rocks, better view of the lake. |
| 12:30pm |        | Finished lunch and reading book. Put legs in lake. Cold.                                                                                                                 |
