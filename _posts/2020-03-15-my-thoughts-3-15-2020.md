It's Sunday night. I'm in my room alone sitting on my bed thinking about the last few days.

I got laid off on Wednesday.

Bitcoin went down 50% on Thursday.

Friday I got food with Jake and Pete.

Saturday I quarentined.

Today I thought a lot about what's next.

My roommate has a girl over who works as a flight attendent. I'm not a hipocrit, but she probably has this thing...So it's really weird to be here.
