Last weekend I went to the MIT Bitcoin Expo in Cambridge, MA to try to gain a deeper understanding of what is going on in the space and what people are working on. The conference had me walking away confident in the strength of the Bitcoin community and it's drive and focus on making this project successful.

There were a lot of people I follow on Twitter and elsewhere on the web that gave great talks including Nic Carter, Pierre Rochard, Tadge Dryja from MIT's Digital Currency Initiative, Jeremy Welsh from Casa, Peter Van Valkenburg, Meltem Demirors, and a ton more that I'll just post the schedule at the bottom of this post (the talks I attended are bolded).

What I liked about the conference at MIT is that it really got down to the knitty gritty on almost every facet of the issues facing the project at the moment. It was refreshing to walk in on Day 1 and have Andrew Poelstra from Blockstream walking through the math of how multisignature transcations work in Bitcoin instead of people talking about abstract ideas of governance and other theoretical stuff that, quite frankly, doesn't matter.

The project right now is working towards a few different goals:
1. Scaling
 - Reducing the amount of data neeeded to get a verified view of the network
 - Reducing the amount of data put on the blockchain (lightning, schnorr signatures)

2. Privacy
 - Increasing the privacy on Layer 1 via Coinjoins, Lightning

3. Legal
 - Clarity on bitcoin as an asset class, money transmission laws, custodianship, securities

4. Onboarding
 - Wallets and tools to make it easy for users to get Bitcoin, run their own nodes, program new projects on it

I would also throw "network incentives" on the list because of the talk that Nic Carter discussing the future of Bitcoin's fee market and inflation rate, which was somewhat controversial from some people at the conference and online. As Nic said in his talk, I don't think we'll have to worry about the fee market for another ten years or so, and that's fine. As the amount of new Bitcoins being created decreases, we will see a steady rise in the fee placed on transactions, and competition amongst miners will keep prices and the system in balance.
