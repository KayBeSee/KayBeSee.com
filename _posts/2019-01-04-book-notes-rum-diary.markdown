<!-- ![The Rum Diary - Hunter S Thompson]({{site.url}}/assets/img/rum-diary.jpg) -->

I have been researching taking a trip to Puerto Rico this spring and found this gem in the bookstore by my house, which just so happens to take place in San Juan, Puerto Rico in the early 1960s. I read the majority of it when I was at my parents' over winter break.

The story is very typical gonzo and follows a young journalist working at The Daily News and his interactions with co-workers, women, and native Puerto Ricans. I didn't think it was as..._extreme_ in the drug department as the two Fear and Loathing books, but it made me want to pack my suitcase and get down to Al's for a drink and shoot the shit with some reporters.
