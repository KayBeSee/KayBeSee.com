I am a software engineer at [Losant](http://losant.com), a startup building a platform that enables enterprise companies to build Internet of Things applications. When I'm not online, I prefer being outside, travelling to new places, and listening to good music.

I blog about what I'm interested in, which tends to change on a monthly basis. The only constant in my life has been going to see live music.

My favorite bands are [Widespread Panic](http://www.widespreadpanic.com), [Pigeons Playing Ping Pong](http://pigeonsplayingpingpong.com), and [Phish](http://phish.com). I listen to a lot of bluegrass, southern rock, and straight up rock 'n roll.
